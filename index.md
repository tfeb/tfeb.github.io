Some things I have made.

## xkcd-936: random passphrases
Based on [xkcd 936](https://www.xkcd.com/936/).  Python 2.7 or 3.  [Documentation](xkcd-936/) / [Source code](https://github.com/tfeb/xkcd-936).

## Conduit packages for Common Lisp
Conduit packages are packages which serve as conduits for one or more underlying packages: they let you make a system which consists of several implementation packages available through one package, or to provide packages which extend other packages, or replace some symbols they export with symbols from a different package.

## Some Common Lisp tools
A collection of fairly miscellaneous Common Lisp tools, which I have written over the years in order to generally get stuff done.  Slowly growing as I unearth things and publish them.

[Documentation](tfeb-lisp-tools/) / [Source code](https://https://github.com/tfeb/tfeb-lisp-tools)

## Some Common Lisp hacks
A collection of small Common Lisp hacks I've written over the last thirty-odd years.  Some of them are genuinely useful, some of them are little more than toys written long ago to prove a point on `comp.lang.lisp`.  They are largely independent of each other.
